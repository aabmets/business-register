# e-Business Register

## Description
A project for my portfolio which showcases the use of GraphQL for communication between a Vite + React frontend and a Starlette + PostgreSQL backend. 
The backend server source code has **2382** lines of code, where the most important source files are covered **100%** by tests (**~80%** total). 
The frontend source code consists of **2087** lines of code, which have been tested through exploratory testing. 
Altogether, the project consists of about **4500** lines of source code. 
The project took about four workweeks to complete.

*Note 1: The guide above is valid for Windows OS.*  
*Note 2: It is recommended to install PostgreSQL with the default settings (port: **5432**, user/pass: **postgres**)*    
*If you install Postgres with custom settings, you must also edit the app_config.toml file in the backend folder.*
